- Services for: account balance, task create, list, status, full report, single URL, invoice create, VIP queue.
- Background jobs for task status polling; store reports; map provider codes.

Phase 2: User Dashboard & Task UI
- Balance widget; create task (CSV/text bulk up to 10,000); task list with filters; task detail with report download; resubmit failed links; VIP if under 100 links.
- Notifications for errors, low balance, success.

Phase 3: Payments (PayPal)

- Jobs/Queue: polling, report fetching, notifications.
- Policies & Gates for admin/user access.
- Config in `.env` for API keys and PayPal credentials.

Milestones & Deliverables
